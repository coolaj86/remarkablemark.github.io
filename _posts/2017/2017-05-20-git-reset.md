This post goes over how to use use [`git reset`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Reset-Demystified) to undo a commit or go back to a previous state:

- [Soft](#soft)
- [Mixed](#mixed)
- [Hard](#hard)

## Prerequisites

Let's say you have the following commit history:

```sh
git log --oneline
e848206 current commit
0923435 previous commit
```

## Soft

Reset the index and _keep the changes in the staging area_ with [`git reset --soft`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#git-reset---soft):

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # or replace `HEAD~1` with the commit hash
```

The **HEAD** pointer will change to the previous commit:

```sh
git log HEAD --oneline --no-walk
0923435 previous commit
```

And the changes will appear as _changes to be commmitted_:

```sh
git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   file.txt
```

## Mixed

Reset the index and _keep the changes in the working tree_ with [`git reset --mixed`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#git-reset---mixed):

```sh
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```

Output:

```
Unstaged changes after reset:
M   file.txt
```

This option is also the **_default mode_**.

Similarly, the **HEAD** pointer will be updated:

```sh
git log HEAD --oneline --no-walk
0923435 previous commit
```

And the changes will appear in the working tree:

```sh
git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   file.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Hard

Reset the index and _discard the changes_ with [`git reset --hard`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset#git-reset---hard):

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

Output:

```
HEAD is now at 0923435 previous commit
```

As you can see, the changes are not kept:

```sh
git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Final Note

What if you performed a reset but want to undo it?

You can undo it by going back to the previous reference update:

<!--email_off-->

```sh
git reset HEAD@{1}
```

<!--/email_off-->

If you're curious, you can see all your reference logs with [reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog):

```sh
git reflog
```
