Given the following:

```sh
$ echo 'Hello, world' > file.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Add file'
```

And [replacing](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-basics-of-using-the-sed-stream-editor-to-manipulate-text-in-linux) `world` with `Mark`:

```sh
$ sed -i.bak 's/world/Mark/' file.txt
```

### git diff

You can inspect the changes with `git diff`:

```sh
$ git diff
-Hello, world
+Hello, Mark
```

Additionally, the `--word-diff` option is helpful for side-by-side comparisons per line:

```sh
$ git diff --word-diff
Hello, [-world-]{+Mark+}
```

If you stage the changes for commit:

```sh
$ git add file.txt
```

You can inspect the diff again with `--cached` or `--staged`:

```sh
$ git diff --cached
```

And you can even compare branches:

```sh
$ git diff master..dev
```

As well as revisions:

```sh
$ git diff af5626b..6fd855f
```
