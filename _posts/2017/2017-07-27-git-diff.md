This post goes over how to inspect changes with [`git diff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff).

## Prerequisites

Given the following:

```sh
echo 'Hello, world' > file.txt && git add . && git commit -m 'add file'
```

The text `world` is [replaced](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-basics-of-using-the-sed-stream-editor-to-manipulate-text-in-linux) with `Mark`:

```sh
sed -i.bak 's/world/Mark/' file.txt
```

## git diff

Inspect the changes with `git diff`:

```sh
git diff
-Hello, world
+Hello, Mark
```

Additionally, `--word-diff` is useful for side-by-side comparisons per line:

```sh
git diff --word-diff
Hello, [-world-]{+Mark+}
```

If you stage the changes for commit:

```sh
git add file.txt
```

You can inspect the diff again with `--cached` or `--staged`:

```sh
git diff --cached
```

You can even compare branches:

```sh
git diff master..dev
```

As well as revisions:

```sh
git diff af5626b..6fd855f
```
