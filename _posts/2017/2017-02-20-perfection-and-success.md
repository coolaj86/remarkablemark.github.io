_**Perfection** can be the **antithesis** to **success**._

Many of you may call BS on that statement. You might say something like, "But what about companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla? Aren't they constantly _perfecting_ their products?"

You're right, they are. But the intent of my statement is towards the _average human being_ and not towards the _corporate behemoths_ that have the resources to build the perfect product from the get-go.

For us, _shipping is essential_ because if we don't, we'll never get real-life _feedback_. And if we delay getting _feedback_, then we'll never know if what we're doing is _working_ or not.

This is why perfection can be the antithesis to success. It paralyzes us and creates the illusion that we're making progress, when in actuality, progress is validating the product ideas with users.

Even when we think a product is _done_, it's _never_ ever _finished_. In the spirit of [kaizen](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), a product can be forever tweaked and improved upon.

So don't let the _fear_ or _discomfort_ of imperfection stop you from shipping. There's always certainty in releasing an imperfect product that can be perfected afterwards, but there's little to no certainty in releasing a product when it's truly done.

Accordingly, it makes more sense to rephrase the earlier statement to _perfection can be the antithesis to **getting things done**_. I can attest to this because this post has been sitting in my drafts folder since last year.
