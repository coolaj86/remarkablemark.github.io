Let's say you have a simple webpage:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the script generated by [webpack]({% post_url 2016/2016-09-23-webpack-getting-started %}):

```js
// main.js
console.log('hello world');
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './main.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};
```

Wouldn't it be nice to set up **automatic page refresh/reload** during development?

With [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html), this can be done.

### Install

Install [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) and [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack):

```sh
$ npm install webpack-dev-server@1 webpack@1
```

### Run Server

The quickest way to start the server is to run the local binary:

```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
# if it's installed globally, you can run `webpack-dev-server`
```

You should be able to view the page on `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`.

Additionally, you can create an [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) for convenience:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server"
  }
}
```

This allows you to start the server with:

```sh
$ npm start
```

### Update

Now if you edit `main.js` and save the file:

```js
// main.js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

You should get that log in your browser console.
