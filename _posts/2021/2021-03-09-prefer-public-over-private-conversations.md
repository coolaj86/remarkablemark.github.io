excerpt: Why a team should prefer public over private conversations.

Great organizations are transparent, and the best teams communicate openly.

Why is this important? Because public conversations promote knowledge sharing, while private discussions hide information.

To build a culture of high-performing teams, you need:

- talented people,
- organizational clarity,
- and accountability.

When implemented correctly, this creates a feedback loop of **_doing_** and **_learning_**.

Worst case scenario, public conversations generate a lot of noise. But if we use the right tools, we have the ability to mute or remove ourselves from such conversations.

In the end, I would rather have a lot of noise than cricket silence. The former can be used to derive actionable insights, whereas the latter won't help us achieve anything.
