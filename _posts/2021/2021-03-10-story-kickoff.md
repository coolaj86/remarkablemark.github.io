## What

What's a _story kickoff_? Like the name implies, it's an event to kick off the story with key stakeholders before working on it.

## Why

Why should development teams do story kickoffs? Because a story kickoff:

- Confirms the requirements and approach
- Creates clarity and alignment with the team
- Calls out risks and uncertainties
- Shares knowledge and ideas

Every ticket goes through a lifecycle from `Open` to `Done`. Changes are cheaper when they're introduced early, and they get more expensive to implement later on.

Imagine a developer who goes down the wrong path but isn't called out until the review stage. The developer and the team pays for the lost time and effort. Plus, the developer has to start from scratch again.

This is why there are so many checkpoints in [agile development](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development):

- Grooming
- Estimation
- Kickoff
- Review
- Desk Check
- QA
- Release

The purpose of each checkpoint is to check in with the team and shorten the _feedback loop_ and _adaptation cycle_. The earlier we catch something, the less waste, inefficiency, and impediments we experience later on.

## How

Kickoffs can be _synchronous_ or _asynchronous_. Synchronous kickoffs are done over meetings and asynchronous kickoffs can be done over threads.

During the kickoff process, the assignee confirms:

- The acceptance criteria with the product manager
- The mockup with design
- The technical requirements with developers
- The test plan with quality analysts

He or she will go over the approach and call out any uncertainties/risks. The team will weigh in on the proposal and provide any additional comments, questions, or insights.

Once the team approves the kickoff, then the assignee can move the ticket from `Ready for Dev` to `In Progress`.

In the scenario where further investigation is required, the assignee can move the ticket to `In Progress` first before doing the kickoff.
