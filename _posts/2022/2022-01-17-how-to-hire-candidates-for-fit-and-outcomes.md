This article goes over how to hire candidates based on fit and outcomes.

## Candidate Fit

There are two criteria for candidate fit:

1. **Cultural Fit**: If the candidate has the values and personality to succeed at the organization.
2. **Technical Fit**: If the candidate has the skills and experience to succeed at the role.

Most of the time, you want to hire candidates with both cultural and technical fit.

|                      | Technical Fit | Not Technical Fit |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Cultural Fit**     | ✅ Hire       | ❌ Reject         |
| **Not Cultural Fit** | ❌ Reject     | ❌ Reject         |

But for an entry-level position, you can consider hiring a person with a cultural fit if you're willing to _train_ the person on the technical-side.

## Hiring Outcome

There are four hiring outcomes:

1. **True Positive**: You hired a good candidate.
2. **True Negative**: You rejected a bad candidate.
3. **False Positive**: You hired a bad candidate.
4. **False Negative**: You rejected a good candidate.

Most of the time, you want to get good at identifying _(1) true positives_ and _(2) true negatives_ because that's knowing who to hire and who to reject.

|           | Positive     | Negative          |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| **True**  | ✅ Good Hire | ✅ Good Rejection |
| **False** | ❌ Bad Hire  | ❌ Bad Rejection  |

Organizations would rather reject a good candidate than hire a bad candidate because of the impact a bad hire can leave on the team.

As a result, hiring managers have two goals:

1. Move good candidates forward the pipeline as quickly as possible.
2. Remove bad candidates from the pipeline as early as possible.

Why? Because time is money:

- There needs to be _urgency_ to make good candidates offers before they're snatched up or given competing offers by other companies. (_Maximize your leverage._)
- If a bad candidate moves down the pipeline, then you're _wasting_ your employees' time interviewing someone who will not work out. (_Minimize your cost._)

Strong organizations are good at evaluating candidates and have a consistent process that can ensure repeatable outcomes.

If you don't have a process, then work with your team to create one. Rate each candidate against a scorecard of attributes and competencies required for the role. Manage and measure your pipeline so you can continuously improve it.
