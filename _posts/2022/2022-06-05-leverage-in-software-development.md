To apply leverage to software development:

- Instead of building on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), use a [PaaS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Instead of creating a custom app, use a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Instead of styling from scratch, use a [design system](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_system) like [Material UI](https://mui.com/).
- Instead of architecting a [CMS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), use an open source or paid alternative like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/).
- Instead of writing security functions, use a battle-tested module like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

With leverage, you increase feedback loops but give up control. It's more valuable when working with small teams trying to move fast.
