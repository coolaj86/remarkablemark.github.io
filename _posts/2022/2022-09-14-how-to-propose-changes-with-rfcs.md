This post goes over how to propose changes with [RFCs (Request for Comments)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments).

## RFC

Request for Comments (RFC) is a useful tool for proposing, sharing, and discussing a change you'd like to make.

Goals:

- Convey a problem or change.
- Get buy-in from stakeholders for a proposal.
- Document the reasons for a decision.

RFCs can be:

- A process update.
- A technical change.
- A decision on a vendor.
- Anything you want feedback on.

## RFC Template
