## Preparation

1. Select a topic
2. Come up with an outline
3. Write a script

Follow the 3 parts:

1.  Introduction
2.  Body
3.  Conclusion

Remember to:

- Identify your target audience
- Have a goal or objective

## Tools

## Record

- Find a soundproof environment to record
  - Make sure there are no background noises (machines are off, windows are closed, etc.)

  - Normalize audio
- Review

  - Watch on multiple devices to verify quality (cheap/expensive headphones and speakers as well as different screen sizes)
  - Take breaks and rereview to get a fresh perspective
