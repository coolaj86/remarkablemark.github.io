If I were to make a metaphor for life, then it would be the act of sailing. We all start in a basic boat. There are no sails or fancy equipment. And let's not forget, we're in the middle of the sea.

In the beginning, all we can do is drift. The waters and the wind move us about. There's really not much we can do to control where we're heading. But as we start to collect materials that drift about in the sea, we're able to build tools. Our first tool might be a sail for the boat. Although the sail might not be professionally made, it does what it's made to do—and that is to help us steer our boat.

Since all we can see is blue, we lack a sense of direction. So we construct a telescope. Now, we can peer through the looking glass to see things from a distance. Nonetheless, improvements can still be made to see farther and more clearly. Sometimes we can identify things, but other times we cannot. For instance, we might not be able to differentiate between a floating log and a large fish swimming right below the surface.

As we start to pick up more materials, we're able to craft our next tool, which is a compass. We have something to guide us now. Whether it's dark or stormy, we use the compass to point us towards the direction we want to go.

Given that we're crafting more often, we level up and so do our tools. Our sails are thicker and easier to control. We're able to maneuver our boat with greater precision and efficiency. Our telescope has higher magnification and the image is sharper. Our compass is more consistent in pointing towards true north.

All of a sudden, we see something in the distance. It's green and brown. On closer inspection, it's an island. Filled with excitement, we embark towards that direction. We reach it and discover something interesting. We bring it aboard our ship. This cycle of finding and navigating towards destinations repeat itself. Sometimes it's an island, other times it's a shipwreck. Although not every excursion is fruitful, it's still part of the experience and from that, we gain something from it.

And this is similar to how we sail through life. We start out without a destination; but over time, we start to form one. This happens when we learn, grow, and develop the tools and experiences that help us get there. When we reach our destination, we might get something out of it. Then we set towards our next destination. Not all outcomes are expected nor do they return a material reward; sometimes the intrinsic is more valuable than the extrinsic. Success and failure are both part of what makes sailing fun. Sometimes, mistakes can lead us to greater riches. Look at how Christopher Columbus turned out.

When we become captains of our own life, we're able to go wherever we want. Although our destination may change, our journey to discover our treasure—however you define it—is everlasting.
