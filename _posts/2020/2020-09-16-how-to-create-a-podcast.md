## Preparation

- Come up with a topic
- Find guest(s) to interview
- Write a script
  - A detailed script leaves less room for error and nervousness, but the conversation will be less organic and spontaneous
  - Use an outline for more improvised discussions
  - Don't forget that mistakes can be edited out
- Remember to:
  - Tell a story
  - Keep it informative
  - Stay consistent with your style

## Tools

- Get a good microphone
  - Headset or USB microphone
- Download [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- Pick an online voice provider
  - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
  - [Google](https://meet.google.com/)
  - [Slack](https://slack.com/)
  - [Skype](https://www.skype.com/)

## Record

- Find a good time and place to record
  - Make sure there are no background noises (machines are off, window is shut, etc.)
- Perform a test recording and play it back for quality control
- [Double ender](https://thepodcastersstudio.com/tps-ep-47-recording-a-double-ender-podcast/)
  - Host and guest record audio separately
  - Expect latency on the web
  - Clap at the beginning to sync the audio

## Editing

- Audio cleaning
  - Trim unnecessary pauses
  - Cut out fillers like "uhs" and "ums"
  - Remove background noise
  - Delete clicks with [iZotope RX De-click](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx/features/de-click.html)
  - Normalize audio
- Review audio
  - Make sure flow and delivery is good
  - Listen on multiple devices to verify quality (cheap/expensive headphones and speakers)
  - Playback at low audio as a litmus test

## Publish

- See post "[How to publish a podcast for free]({% post_url 2020/2020-09-08-upload-free-podcast %})"
- For podcast discoverability:
  - Use social media
  - Publish a written article (there are [free]({% post_url 2020/2020-08-24-python-speech-recognition %}) and paid transcription tools that can convert your audio into text)
  - Upload videos
