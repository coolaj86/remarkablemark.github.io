## Preparation

- Come up with a topic
- Find guest(s) to interview
- Write a script
  - A detailed script leaves less room for error and nervousness, but the conversation will be less organic and spontaneous
  - Use an outline for more improvised discussions
  - Don't forget that mistakes can be edited out

## Tools

  - Headset or USB microphone
- Download [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
- Pick an online voice provider
  - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
  - [Google](https://meet.google.com/)
  - [Slack](https://slack.com/)
  - [Skype](https://www.skype.com/)

## Record

- Find a good time and place to record
  - Make sure there are no background noises (machines are off, window is shut, etc.)
- Perform a test recording
  - Play it back for quality control

- Clap at beginning to sync audio

  - Cut out fillers like "uhs" and "ums"
