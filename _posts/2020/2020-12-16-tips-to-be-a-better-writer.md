## 1. Understand your goal

What's your **purpose** for writing? Who's your _audience_? What's your expected _outcome_?

## 2. Write for simplicity

Write in a **succinct** manner. Be aware of the [curse of knowledge](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). Make no assumptions. It's always better to be _explicit_ than _implicit_. Don't _overcomplicate_ ideas. _Engage_ the reader.

## 3. Proofread

Read and reread your piece. Ask someone to give feedback. Look for areas to _clarify_, _reduce_, and _eliminate_. Focus on **readability** and getting your _message_ across.
