## Create opportunities to write

You shouldn't make excuses for not writing because you have more free time than you realize:

- When you wake up
- During your commute
- During a break
- When you're in the bathroom
- When you're waiting for something
- When you feel inspired
- When you feel bored
- Before you go to bed
- During the weekends

Examine your daily schedule because you can find many moments to write.

## Place yourself in the right environment

You can accomplish a lot of writing when you're in the right environment:

- In bed
- On the couch
- Indoors
- At the office
- Outdoors
- In nature
- In a quiet place
- In a noisy place

Find the settings that is conducive to writing and condition yourself to write in them.

## Quantity over quality

There are two obstacles that every writer faces:

1. [Writer's block](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block)
2. [Perfectionism](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)>)

To resolve writer's block, you can:

- take a break
- go on a detour
- get inspired
- constrain your writing to a theme

To overcoming perfectionism, _turn off your self-editing mode_.

> Write first, edit later.

Let your stream of consciousness take over and focus on _quantity over quality_. Follow the [Pareto principle](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) since most of your writing will suck and that should be a given. However, 20% of your writing will contain gems. So it's a good skill to be able to write more. Set a timer and force yourself to write nonstop.

> "[Perfect is the enemy of the good](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)"

This is something even I struggle with daily (see post "[Perfection and success]({% post_url 2017/2017-02-20-perfection-and-success %})").

## Work in sprints

This is similar to [quantity over quality](#quantity-over-quality). When you try to do everything at once, it can lead to [perfection paralysis](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). So it's recommended to work in _short bursts_.

Some authors who follow this strategy leave their work partially finished so they can come back to it later. This way, _motivation is maintained_ and _burnout is prevented_.

_Work in sprints_, don't do everything at once.

## Find your workflow style

Just like how some people are _visual_ learners and others are _auditory_ learners, you'll need to find the style that works best for you.

You can experiment with:

- typing
- writing by hand
- dictating
- recording a video or call

Some authors don't do any writing but are interviewed on a topic. The interview then gets transcribed and edited into an article or book. Ultimately, writing is more about _what you have to say_ than how it gets done.

Every individual is unique, so you want to discover the approach that **best fits you**.

## Gamify the act

[Gamification](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) can keep us engaged. With the proper rewards and punishments, we can use this technique to keep ourselves committed and on track. Jerry Seinfeld does this by forcing himself to [write a joke a day](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy).

So figure out what your daily activity is going to be and hold yourself accountable so you **don't break the chain**. Write everyday.

## Enjoy the process

For some, writing is a form of _enjoyment_, but for others, it's a _chore_. If you feel _stressed_ about writing, ask yourself, "When did this start happening?"

Don't feel intimidated that your writing needs to be great (focus on [quantity over quality](#quantity-over-quality)). Writing is an act of _self-expression_. Never feel that what you write (personally) is going to be judged by others.

If you have any _trauma_ related to writing, let it surface. Acknowledge it and move on. Revisit your reasons for writing again. Find a happy memory and use that as a starting point so you can enjoy writing again.
