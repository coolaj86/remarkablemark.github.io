These days, I find **negative** feedback to be more _valuable_ than **positive** feedback. Why? Because saying something nice is _easier_ than identifying problems and fixing them.

Of course, the **positive** feedback that I value is _thoughtful_ and _constructive_. When provided correctly, it will encourage good _future behavior_. But it's also vital to mix and match praise and criticism (3:1 ratio). This is because constant criticism can affect morale so it's important to know when to deliver it.

A team consists of individuals, and individual human beings are _imperfect_. Thus, no team is perfect, which makes _developing_ them crucial as a team lead or manager.

When a team becomes _aware_ of what works and what doesn't, then the team is able to _improve_ itself. Achieving and maintaining such a [feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) is every manager's dream.

[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) is a Japanese term that means "_continuous improvement_." It's a philosophy that many high-performing teams embrace. Once it's part of your team's _processes_ and _culture_, it can lead to [compounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) returns for your organization.
