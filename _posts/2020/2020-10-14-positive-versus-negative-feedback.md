These days, I find negative feedback to be more valuable than positive feedback. Why? Because finding something nice to say is easier than identifying issues and resolving them.

Of course, the positive feedback that I value is thoughtful and constructive. When provided correctly, it will encourage good future behavior. But it's also vital to mix and match praise and criticism (e.g., 3:1 ratio). This is because constant criticism can affect a team's morale so it's important to time it right.

Teams consist of individuals, and individual human beings are imperfect. Hence, no team is perfect and looking for ways to develop the members is crucial. This is especially true when you're a team lead or manager.

When a team starts developing awareness to what's working and what's not, then the team becomes self-sustaining. This means there's a [feedback loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback) for self-improvement. Achieving and maintaining such a cycle is every manager's dream.

[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) is a Japanese term that means "continuous improvement." It's a philosophy that many high-performing teams embrace. Once it's part of your team's processes and culture, it can lead to [compounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) returns for your organization.
