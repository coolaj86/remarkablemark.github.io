Given you have a recorded and edited a podcast and have finished the cover artwork, this article will go over how to upload your podcast without having to pay anything.

## Upload to Hosting Platform

Upload your podcast to a hosting platform like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). It's free as long as you're within the upload limit; otherwise, you can upgrade to the [pro plan](https://checkout.soundcloud.com/pro).

After your podcast is uploaded, you want to [add your track to your RSS feed](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003451347).

Go to your track and click **Edit** > **Permissions** > **Include in RSS feed**:

![Include in RSS feed]({{ "/images/2020/2020-09-08-soundcloud-permissions-include-in-rss-feed.png" | prepend: site.assets_path }})

To get the RSS feed URL, go to [Content Settings](http://soundcloud.com/settings/content). The URL will look something like this:

```
https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:123456789/sounds.rss
```

For verification to work when submitting your podcast to other directories, make sure to [display your email address in your RSS feed](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003447807).

Check out the help article ["Getting started with podcasting"](Getting started with podcasting) for more information.

## Submit to Directories

Once your podcast is hosted and the RSS feed is available, you can submit the RSS feed to other podcast directories.

### Apple

1. Create an [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316).
2. Sign in to [Podcasts Connect](https://itunespartner.apple.com/podcasts/).
3. Podcasts Connect requires an [iTunes Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201762) account. If you don't meet this requirement, then sign into [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) with your Apple ID.
4. [Validate](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/my-podcasts/new-feed) your podcast RSS feed URL.
5. Submit the podcast once the validation status is green.
6. Apple will review your podcast and send an email once the review process is complete.

### Spotify

2. Submit your podcast to [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/submit) by adding the link to your podcast's RSS feed.
3. Verify that you own this podcast and fill out the podcast details.
4. Once it's submitted, it'll take a few hours for it to show up on Spotify.

### Google

1. Create a [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441).
2. In the past, podcasts would be published to [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/podcasts/publish). But today, podcasts are published to [Google Podcasts Manager](https://podcastsmanager.google.com/).
