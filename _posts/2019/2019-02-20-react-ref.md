Have you ever tried to access a React [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) in the [`render()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render) method?

You might think the following would return the `ref`:

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  myRef = React.createRef();

  render() {
    console.log(this.myRef);
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```

But it actually returns:

```js
{
  current: null;
}
```

So what gives?

Well if you think about it, a `ref` is a _reference_ to a [DOM node](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node). Hence, the `ref` is only available when the DOM has rendered.

Most of the time, we're using refs in [events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) like `onClick` handlers. In those cases, the DOM is already ready by the time the user interacts with the element.

The quickest way to access a ref is in [`componentDidMount`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount):

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  myRef = React.createRef();

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.myRef);
  }

  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```

That's because the lifecycle is invoked immediately after the component is mounted.

If you need to access the `ref` in `render()`, then you can use [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html):

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  myRef = React.createRef();

  state = { isMounted: false };

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ isMounted: true });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.isMounted) {
      console.log(this.myRef);
    }
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
}
```
