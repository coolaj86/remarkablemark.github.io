[Erik Boesen](https://github.com/ErikBoesen) made something pretty _remarkable_ on his last day at [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com/) as an intern.

Introducing&hellip; [**markipsum**](https://erikboesen.com/mipsum/)

![markipsum]({{ "/gifs/2019/2019-08-16-markipsum.gif" | prepend: site.assets_path }})

**markipsum** is a [website](https://erikboesen.com/mipsum/) and [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markipsum) for generating random things I've said.

With `markipsum`, you no longer need `lorem ipsum`. ðŸ˜‰

You can view his [code](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/mipsum) on GitHub.
