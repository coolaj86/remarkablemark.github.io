### The Rule of Three

1. Start with **why** your audience should read the post.
2. Once they're hooked, tell them **what** they need to hear.
3. Finally, end with an **action item** they can take from the post.

_Why_ must come before _what_. _What_ must come before _how_.

Keep it succinct and digestible. That's all! ðŸ˜ƒ
